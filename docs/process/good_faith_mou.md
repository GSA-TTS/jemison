# **A Good Faith MOU**

A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is a contract. A soured relationship is not helped by the existence of a contract. By the time it is “needed,” an MOU is a hammer  applied too late in the context of growing and nurturing a team. 

The *writing* of a MOU can be extremely valuable. Writing the MOU lets the team spell out what they think is important in relationships. It lets individuals say what they need to be successful and whole in their work. It is an exercise in trust building and empathetic understanding of others. As a non-contractual document, we could call this a *good faith MOU*. It is a *social* contract, to be upheld by everyone on a team in all their work.

This is a living and aspirational document. It does not need to be perfect. We will revisit it as part of our retrospective process, and can edit, grow, or shrink it as needed. Footnotes are used to capture *actions* and *behaviors* we can engage in to work towards our aspirations.

* **Warmth**. We are, first and foremost, human beings worthy of respect and compassion, continuing to live at work under pandemic conditions. We all are experiencing this differently. While our cup may feel more or less full on any given day, we aspire to bring our most compassionate selves to the work we do and our interactions with our colleagues[^1].  
* **Trust**. Trust is earned through words and actions. It comes from doing what we say we will do, when we say we will do it. It comes from saying when we misjudged, and our goals might not be achieved the way we hoped. Open, honest communication is foundational to trust[^2].    
  * Across the team, we consistently expressed that we value accountability, transparency, and regular open/frank communication. These are all things that lay foundations for *trust*.  
* **Working in the open**. As federal employees, our work grows the public domain. As much as possible, we also hope our words and actions might model how this work can also take place openly. In doing so, it encourages others to contribute to our efforts of improving the government and it’s processes *for the benefit of the people[^3]*.  
  * Clear commitments and transparent milestones are more easily achieved when the work is open.   
* **Collaboration**. We value working together. It is easier to brainstorm, to explore ideas, to get unstuck, and to push each other when we are working together[^4].   
* **Documentation**. Our work should be documented. More specifically, we should 1\) try and document the rationale for important design decisions (without which, we might “roll back” a decision that was made for good reason), 2\) document work products (so that others can pick them up and continue the work), and 3\) document reflections (so that we can communicate what and why about our work led to success or failure)[^5].   
* **Be bold**. In open, collaborative work, being bold means many things. It might mean *not asking permission*, especially when using tools where changes can easily be rolled back. With regards to our thinking, it means avoiding mental locks, like believing we have to do things that are *logical*, or that we have to come up with *the right answer.* While it is true that we have milestones to achieve, part of good agile practice is also knowing how and when to pivot, and that occasionally requires us to be bold. The appendix provides a bit more context for what it might mean to “be bold.”

## **Appendix: A Whack on the Side of the Head**

Roger von Oech wrote the book *A Whack on the Side of the Head*. It’s a fun book. A light read.

At the core of this (small) book are ten mental locks that we tend to constrain ourselves with. He gives them names, and they are mostly self-explanatory: they're the kinds of things we say to ourselves to keep us from moving forward, or trying new things:

* The right answer
* That's not logical
* Follow the rules
* Be practical
* Play is frivolous
* That's not my area
* Don't be foolish
* Avoid ambiguity
* To err is wrong
* I'm not creative

These phrases have their time and place. But, we also want to question them as part of our 10x-funded entrepreneurial work, and make sure that we’re challenging ourselves to deliver the best value to our partners and *the people*. We do this by balancing well-established practices with a willingness to make mistakes and try things that are new (to us, or to everyone).

 

[^1]:  We can remember to start meetings by checking in, and listening to our colleagues. Sometimes, making space for out-of-band conversations (“virtual coffee”) to unpack things can help, too.

[^2]:  Regular retrospective processes that look at how we are doing our work as individuals and as a team will help foster a space for open dialogue about what we are doing, why, and how we might engage best individually and as a team.

[^3]:  “Working in the open” means many things. Making repositories public, licensing things with open/libre licenses, and (perhaps more importantly), building *open community* around the work itself. This takes effort, but without community and engagement, we achieve *free* or *openly available*, but not open engagement.

[^4]:  There are some tasks that benefit from parallel workstreams (“divide and conquer,” to use the language of colonizers). However, there are many tasks that benefit from cowork sessions. In addition, coworking builds knowledge of each-other, and therefore trust.

[^5]:  Where possible, an important part of our development practice will be *automation*. This is sometimes called *DevOps* or *DevSecOps.* “Development Operations” means that we write code that builds, tests, deploys, tests, and runs our code. (There’s at least two *different* kinds of testing we can do.) Good devops practices make it more likely that others can pick up and continue our work, because the difficult work of building, deploying, and testing our code is, in a word, “self-documenting.”

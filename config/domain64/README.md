# adding domains

Until further notice...

1. Add it to the appropriate `tld.libsonnet` file. E.g. add to `gov.libsonnet` if the domain is a .gov, etc.
2. Add it to the `schedules.libsonnet`.

A CTRL-F to find the domain that proceeds the new domain in the schedules file makes adding it quick.

We need this to be automated...

# We all serve, @{GitHub Username}, and thank you for yours

We serve the public through our work, and your work on Search.gov was most welcome. As you roll off the team, we still need to close some things out.

- [ ] private team Slack channels
  - [ ] Slack, if leaving TTS but staying within GSA
- [ ] team shared drive(s)
- [ ] team calendar
- [ ] ZD helpdesk instance
- [ ] FigJam (if appropriate)

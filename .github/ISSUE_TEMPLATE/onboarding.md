# Welcome to the team @{GitHub Username}!

{ONBOARDING BUDDY'S GH USERNAME} will be your onboarding buddy and can help you if you get stuck on any of the steps in the checklist below. There's also a separate checklist that your onboarding buddy will tackle!

## For all team members

All team members will want to take the following steps:

- [ ] Review [the project README](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/jemison/blob/main/docs/README.md)
- [ ] Ask in `#search-general` for team members to reach out and setup an intro coffee
- [ ] Complete OLU trainings
- [ ] Review the TTS handbook
  - [ ] https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/getting-started/
  - [ ] https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/about-us/tts-history/
  - [ ] Skim through: https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/
- [ ] Review our [agile processes](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/jemison/blob/main/docs/process/agile.md)
  - [ ] If you are unfamiliar with agile, [this is a good overview](https://digital.gov/event/2019/11/04/foundations-agile-i/)
- [ ] Familiarized yourself with the [Jemison architecture](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/jemison/blob/main/docs/architecture/index.md)

### Systems access

- [ ] Join/get added to the team Slack channels
- [ ] Get added to the team shared drive
- [ ] (Feds) get added to the Federal shared drive
- [ ] Have the team calendar owner share the calendar invite link to our new team member

  - [ ] If you're not already a member of BOTH the [GSA](https://github.com/orgs/GSA/people) and [GSA-TTS](https://github.com/orgs/GSA-TTS/people) GitHub organizations, [follow the process outlined here](https://github.com/GSA/GitHub-Administration#joining-the-gsa-enterprise-organization), requesting access to the appropriate org(s). When it's time to send the mail, look up the Product Lead (see [the staffing list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g8nYqYS_ifFlZB-DBgfeSoJRMB__EqWsmLnacyk-bDI/edit#heading=h.us8xylqg455c)) then start with this template, mailing from your GSA email address:

    ```text
    To: gsa-github.support@gsa.gov
    Cc: [the search lead]
    Subject: GSA and GSA-TTS GitHub organization membership
    Body:
    [Edit the following text to put in your GitHub username and your GSA email address, then remove this instruction text.]
    Please add my GitHub account (https://github.com/myusername) to the following GitHub organizations:
    - https://github.com/GSA
    - https://github.com/GSA-TTS
    
    I will be working on the Search.gov project:
    - https://github.com/GSA-TTS/jemison
    
    I have cc'd the search.gov lead for awareness.
        
    Thank you!
    ```        
    - (Note this step could take a few days; humans handle these requests.)
  - [ ] Once you are added to the GSA-TTS org, ask [the person(s) with the "Maintainer" role to add you to the `searchgov-team` team](https://github.com/orgs/GSA-TTS/teams/searchgov-team/members). This will grant you read/write access to our repositories.

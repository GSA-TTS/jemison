Here’s how you know









 Official websites use .gov 

              A .gov website belongs to an official government
              organization in the United States.
            






 Secure .gov websites use HTTPS 

              A lock (
              
Lock
A locked padlock

              ) or https:// means you’ve safely connected to
              the .gov website. Share sensitive information only on official,
              secure websites.

Audit access management, Search improvements, Summary reports
December 18, 2023
This week we've made improvements to user access roles, search results, and Tribal data access.
What we delivered
We work in an agile manner. That means we have a long-term strategy, medium-term features we work to deliver, and make continuous improvement and bug fixes to the existing product.
Audit access management
We improved the user access experience for single audits. Users can now change both the auditor and auditee certifying official for a submission and add new audit editors.
Future improvements will allow for the removal of other contributors to a submission.
Search improvements
We added the ability to filter search results by auditee state. We also enhanced the results returned by the ALN filter, making it possible to see if a submission includes audit findings.
Tribal data access controls
We have implemented access controls for Tribal audit data, and notified NSACs and KMSALs. This data will now appear in searches for logged in Federal users who have access.
Summary reports
We added the ability to download a summary report for an individual single audit submission. This combines all data from a single SF-SAC into one Excel document.
Pre-certification review
Auditors and auditees can now review a submission after it is validated and locked, but before it is certified.
What's next?
Historic data migration
We continue to work with Census on the migration of historic data.
